#Model-of-our-Classroom
This is a blender project and a Unity build we did for a IEK DELTA 360 assignment to recreate our classroom and make a simple Unity 3D enviroment to explore it. <br>
I hope you enjoy it as much we enjoyed making it! Unfortunately we lost the Unity project files and we only have the build. :(
